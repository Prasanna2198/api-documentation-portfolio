## Profile

Aspiring API Writer with a background in computer science and 5 years of client-facing experience.

I'm transitioning into API documentation, focusing on tools like Postman, Swagger/OpenAPI, and Markdown to create clear, structured, and developer-friendly REST API docs. Currently building a portfolio of real-world projects and seeking entry-level API writing roles in product-based companies.
